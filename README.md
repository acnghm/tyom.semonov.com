# Tyom Semonovâ€™s CV

This repo serves as single source for my current CV. It deploys static site to GH pages and generates PDF from it.

The project is built in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) using [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org).
It uses [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) to generate PDF from site and deploys to 
GH Pages with [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) package.

The site is automatically built and deployed on update to master using CircleCI.  
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/tyom/tyom.semonov.com/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/tyom/tyom.semonov.com/tree/master)

## How it works

The data is stored in separate YAML files in [data](data) directory. The UI is built in Vue using Nuxt which gives SSR
support.

The site is deployed via CircleCI. During the build stage PDF is generated using Puppeteer and the generated files
are pushed to GitHub pages.
